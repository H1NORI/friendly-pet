# 🐾 AR Virtual Pet App

This is an Augmented Reality (AR) mobile app developed in Unity, where users can interact with a virtual pet that can eat, sleep, and play — similar to a Tamagotchi. The pet appears in the real world using AR plane detection and responds to user interactions like tapping and swiping.
